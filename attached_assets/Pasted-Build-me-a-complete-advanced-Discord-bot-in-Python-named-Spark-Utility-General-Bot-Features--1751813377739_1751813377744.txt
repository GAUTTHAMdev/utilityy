Build me a complete, advanced Discord bot in Python named "Spark Utility".

General Bot Features:
- Customizable prefix from environment secret PREFIX.
- Required environment secrets:
  - BOT_TOKEN (Discord bot token)
  - OWNER_ID (owner Discord ID)
  - PREFIX (bot command prefix).
- Bot status must display "Spark Utility | <prefix>help".
- Every command or bot action must log a detailed embed to the OWNER_IDâ€™s DMs with command/action name, who triggered it (username + ID), server & channel, time, arguments used, and errors if any. Ensure logs are reliable and bug-free (handle closed DMs gracefully).
- Organize all features using cogs for maintainability.
- Use discord.py or nextcord with discord.ui for interactivity.
- Include robust error handling and add detailed docstrings/comments explaining how each feature works.

Utility & Moderation Commands:
- ping, serverinfo, userinfo, avatar, servericon, serverbanner, serverowner, servermembers, botinfo, membercount, roleslist, emojislist, channelinfo, invite, uptime.
- Moderation: clear messages (bulk delete), ban, unban, kick, slowmode set/unset.
- Fun/utility: poll (embed yes/no polls), calculator, shorten URL (tinyurl API), quote, urban dictionary search, define, translate, remind, timer, afk, report, suggestions, sayembed, choose, eightball, meme.
- All moderation commands must include permission checks.
- Custom help command: list **every command** with a detailed usage guide in organized embed categories (Moderation, Utility, Fun, Ticketing, etc.).

Advanced Ticket System (better than Ticket Tool):

**Interactive Ticket Panel:**
- Setup command generates a panel embed with buttons or select menus allowing users to open tickets by category (Support, Sales, Appeals, etc.).
- Uses discord.ui buttons/menus for rich interaction.
- Ticket creation:
  - Creates a private channel (e.g., "ticket-username") with correct permission overwrites for the user + staff.
  - Supports category-specific ticket routing: assign tickets to staff teams or categories automatically.
- Ticket controls inside the ticket:
  - Buttons for close, claim, add/remove user, lock/unlock, rename, delete.
- Claiming system:
  - Staff can claim tickets via button/command; ticket is marked with the staff memberâ€™s name.
- Ticket renaming & reassignment commands.
- Auto-archive inactive tickets after configurable time.
- Transcript on close:
  - Automatically generate transcript (full conversation) as text file and send to log channel and/or ownerâ€™s DM.
- Ticket analytics command: shows tickets opened, closed, average closing time, staff performance, and category stats.
- Full ticket logs:
  - Every action (creation, claim, close, delete, reply) is logged in ticket-logs channel and ownerâ€™s DMs.

**Normal Ticket Panel:**
- Setup command creates a classic embed panel with reactions (e.g., ðŸŽ«) that users can click to open a ticket.
- Instructions included in the embed on how to open a ticket.
- Ticket process same as interactive panel after ticket creation.
- Ticket customization command:
  - Customize panel embed title, description, color, footer, thumbnail.

**Additional Ticket System Features:**
- Anti-spam: prevent users from opening multiple simultaneous tickets; if they try, send ephemeral reply or DM.
- Message linking command: creates jump URLs to messages in tickets.
- Commands to add/remove additional users to ticket channels.
- Staff-only close/force-close commands.
- Optional DM ticket creation:
  - Command to let users open a ticket via DM to the bot, creating a ticket in a default server.

Requirements:
- All commands & panels must be fully customizable (role IDs, category IDs, log channel IDs, ticket settings).
- Robust error handling for every ticket command & interaction.
- Provide setup instructions as commands (e.g., `<prefix>ticket-setup interactive`, `<prefix>ticket-setup normal`) with easy-to-follow guide for admins.

Combine all of these features with the utility & moderation commands above in one bot with proper organization, logs, error handling, and a beautiful custom help menu.
